duality-rails
=============

[duality](http://github.com/rubyops/duality) for rails

This is currently very untested. Also, I'm not really a Rails guy, so if anyone want to fork this and send me a pull request, I certainly wouldn't appreciate it.

### Installation through Bundler

#### Not currently working.

        # file: Gemfile
        source :rubygems
        gem 'duality-rails', :git => 'git://github.com/rubyops/duality-rails.git'
